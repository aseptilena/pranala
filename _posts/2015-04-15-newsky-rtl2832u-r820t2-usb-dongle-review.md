After after a short communication with the seller, I decide to purchase another Rafael Micro R820T2 based RTL-SDR  USB dongle (again) from Ebay, well shipping is little bit slow, it takes 2 days after may payment to get the dongle shipped. After waiting around 3 weeks, I got 

And here is my short review on [Newsky RTL2832U R820T2 RTL SDR SMA BNC Coax DAB FM MCX Socket Special Dongle](http://prn.la/1zzfACm) package contents as picture:

I like this dongle since it comes with 3 adapters instead of useless bulkware such as short antenna and remote control. Newsky RTL2832U R820T2 dongle comes with 3 adapters they are SMA pigtail, BNC Female and SMA Male plug and BNC female and Coax (European TV socket). You can also ask the seller to change optional converter of your choice, I'm asking the seller to replace BNC female and Coax (European TV socket) aka Belling Lee with F Type Female Jack to SMA Male plug that more useful for me, all for only 13 USD after 1 USD discount before shipping and handling, almost half in price from my previous [R820T2 USB dongle from Nooelec](http://prana.la/2015/03/25/nooelec-r820t2-rtl-sdr-usb-dongle-review/) 

  
<span class="label label-success"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Warning</span> Please be careful when opening the plastic case, since the plastic case latch can easily snap. Like what I did, I broke the case but don't worry you can change it with other dongle's case if you like. 

What makes this dongle special, it has some hardware modifications that make RTL-SDR enthusiast happy:

1. Yes it uses new tuner chip R820T2 

2. It uses SMD crystal oscillator (remember this is not TCXO) instead of ordinary low-profile HS-49/S crystal. Let's compare with [R820T2 USB dongle from Nooelec](http://prana.la/2015/03/25/nooelec-r820t2-rtl-sdr-usb-dongle-review/) which using HS-49/S crystal instead of SMD. Seller claims it provides near to perfect frequency reading and minimal or no frequency drift, after long operation. No information yet regarding manufacturer of SMD crystal oscillator used in this dongle. I will review on this on my another blog post later.

3. Reinforced MCX socket with soldered around the neck of MCX connector head. Though I never heard someone break the connector head.

4. The most interesting modification it has [Q Branch Direct Sampling](http://prana.la/2015/04/19/rtl-sdr-direct-sampling-mode/) connector pads that allow us to easily attach long wire antenna to it and run it in Q Branch DS mode without breaking the dongle no need to solder tiny pads. You can notice two pads near RTL2832U chip in the picture below.
