### kyllstrap - yet another vanilla Jekyll and Bootstrap Static Web

This is my self-learning project on how to create Jekyll based website with Bootstrap 3.3.2 from scratch inspired by kAworu's [Octostrap3](https://github.com/kAworu/octostrap3) the theme that I'm using on my Octopress based personal website http://prana.la. 

kudos to :

- [kAworu](https://github.com/kAworu) for awesome Octostrap3 and magic trick [Category List Aside](http://kaworu.github.io/octostrap3/blog/2013/10/03/category-list-aside/).
- [alialo's gist](https://gist.github.com/alialo/2255511) for pagination.
- [shigeya](https://github.com/shigeya/jekyll-category-archive-plugin) for category archive generator plugin.
- [havvg](https://github.com/havvg) for [plugin-less XML sitemap](https://github.com/havvg/havvg.github.com/blob/master/sitemap.xml)

The theme itself should be self-explanatory and easy to follow for newbie coders like me.

Feel free to fork, clone and abuse as you like.
